In this take-home exercise, you are required to reveal the demographic structure of Singapore at planning area level by using age-sex pyramid method. Instead of plotting a single age-sex pyramid, however, you are required to display nine selected planning areas on a single view by using trellis display (also know as small-multiple plot).\n\n\n\nTableau Prep Builder version 2022.4: Used for data cleaning to removed unnecessary fields and filtering of relevant fields\nTableau version 2022.4\n\n\n\n\nSingapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022 should be used to prepare the analytical visualisation. It is available at Department of Statistics, Singapore(in short SingStat).\n\n\n\n\nThe analytical visualisation would be uploaded onto Tableau Public.\nA write-up of the take-home exercise would be prepared in Quarto html document format and published on Netlify."
