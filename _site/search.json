It is a “Tableau Hyper” file. Just drag and drop the file into the Tableau window.\n\nIf everything goes well, we will now see the following view.\n\n\nCreating a Trellis Layout\nIn order to create a Trellis Layout, we would need to create two Calculated Fields, “Row” and “Column”. This will tell Tableau how many Rows and Columns to visualse the data.\nClick on the small triangle in the Data Box and select \"Create Calculated Field\" from the drop down box\n\nCreate the following two fields\n\n\nAfter this is done, drag Column, Row, Age Group, Male Population and Female Population into the shelf as shown below\n\n\n\nCreating the population visualisaion\nHowever this doesn’t look quite correct. The reason is because the rows and columns are not calculating based on the Planning Area. to resolve this, we need to drag the PA into the Marks Box and set Rows and Columns to calculate based on PA.\nDrag PA into Marks Box\nclick on small triangle for Columns > select Compute using >select PA\nRepeat for Rows\n\nWe should now end up with the following view. This doesn’t look like an Age-Sex Pyramid yet. We need to set the male x axis to reserve and change the colur.\n\nRight Click X axis, Male Population and select \"Edit Axis\"\n\nCheck \"Reversed\"\n\nThe chart is shaping up to look like an Age-Sex Pyramid now. let’s change the colour to make it clearer.\nDrag \"Sex\"  into \"Color\" under the Marks Box\nWe now have the basic visualisation for an Age -Sex Pyramid organised into a Trellis Displpay.\n\n\n\nAdding Labels\nThe chart is a bit hard to read. we should add lables showing the population numbers for the Male and Female Populations.\nClick Labels under Marks Box > Check \"Show mark labels\"\n\nTableau will automatically select a colour to contrast the lables, however it does not zalways work correct due to different display resolutions. If the text is a bit harder to read on your display. we can change the colours for the sex.\nclick on the small triangle in the legend on the right hand side > select \"edit Colours\" and choose whateever colour u want.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Age-Sex pyramid now shows the gender and population numbers clearly by Age-group, but is still missing the PA name.\n\n\nLabeling each box of a Trellis Display in Tableau\nLabeling Trellis display boxes can be tricky. there is no straightforward way to do it in Tableau. the correct way to do it would be to use a dual axis chart. we would create a new axis and stack it with our existing chart for labeling purpose. First, we create a new axis called “Window Max”. this is done via “create calculated field” again.\n\nNext, we create another table called PA Label which will hold the label data\n\nWe will now drag the “Windows Max” dimension on top of the Male Column as shown below\n\nThe Shelf should now look like this\n\nWe now drag the PA Label onto the text box under “Windows Max” in Marks Box\n\nThe final product would now look like this.\n\nWe can now tidy the formatting by hiding unwanted headers, adding banding and adjusting the fonts to make the chart more readable before moving on to creating a dashboard"

    "text": "Discussion\nA population pyramid (age structure diagram) or “age-sex pyramid” is a graphical illustration of the distribution of a population by age groups and sex and is often used to determine the overall age distribution of a population and an indication of the reproductive capabilities. There are generally three types of population pyramid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrend (Shape)\nCharacteristics\n\n\n\n\nExpansive (Pyramid)\nHigh Birthrates and perhaps high mortality rates. The population is replacing faster than it is dying\n\n\nConstrictive (Square or inverted pyramid)\nPopulation is living longer, but low birth rates. population is not replacing as fast as it’s dying.\n\n\nStationary (Pillar)\nBirthrates and Mortality rates roughly balance each other.\n\n\n\nWhile Age-sex Pyramids are often used to determine if a country’s population is replacing itself fast enough, it may not be useful to analyse the PA break down in this manner, as it is very common for Singaporean’s to move to another area once they reach certain life milestones. for example, when getting married, when their children reach primary school age, and when they reach retirement age. It might be more insightful to cross reference the age-sex pyramid with the age of the PA (mature / non mature estates). What the pyramids do tell us right now is the breakdown of the age groups in each planning area. this can be relevant for city planners to plan for age appropiate amenities in each PA. for example elderly care facilities in PAs with more elderly and schools in younger PA.\nSpecific to the 9 most populated areas in Singgapore, we can observe that the population replacement rate is not replacing fast enough, with a constrictive trend in Woodlands, Choa Chu Kang, Hougang, Sengkang, Yishun and Tampines, Bedok and Jurong West presents a nearly inverted inverted pyramid. only Punggol looks like it has an Expansive trend. It is also interesting to note across all the planning areas have a large number of population difference in the 30s range. This could be due to Singaporeans getting married and moving in to this areas. as this coincides with the average Singaporean Age to get married."

    "text": "Visualisation Critique\nThe following Tableau Visualisation was selected. Observations are highlighted with a box and corresponding serial indicators for reference to the detailed comments below\n\n\nClarity\n(a) Lack of details in title. The title does not tell me what the graph is trying to show, which country or area it is for and is also naming the graph type wrongly. A possible title could have been:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAge-Sex Pyramid for Singapore\nTop 9 most populated planning area - June 2022\n\n\n(b) Bins are too large. To be fair, it’s not totally wrong to use a bin of 10 years, however this choice coupled with the choice of layout (elaborated below under Aesthetic) makes the Age-Sex Pyramid too “flat” and difficult to visually interpret the age-sex patterns.\n(c) Irrelevant data. An average of the population in various age group was shown for the males and females in each Planning Area respectively. this information is not relevant to identifying the patterns from Age-Sex Pyramids and furthermore does not provide further insights for actions and planning.\n(d) Irrelevant visualisation. A box plot was overlaid over the age sex pyramid. Similiar to the above point, it does not help with interpretation and runs the risk of making the graph more messy. the boxplot itself also does not serve it’s own purpose because we are unable to check the details on the limits of the boxplots\n(e) Irrelevant reference line. A reference line was drawn from y-axis somewhere between 11k and 12k population. This reference line serves no purpose. There was no description on what the line is supposed to indicate or tell the reader.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhatever doesn’t add; Subtracts\n\n\n\n\nAesthetics\n(a) Overly wide layout. The choice of layout (1 chart wide) is too wide, causing the Age-Sex Pyramid to be stretched out, making it ugly and difficult to interpret.\n(b) Unclear segregation between axis and graph area. There is currently no segreation between the graph area and the axis. it would be a good idea to give the axis another colour (e.g. Light Grey) so that it’s easier and mroe pleasant to read. The brain would not need to work extra to figure out where the graph and the axis cuts.\n(c) Unclear segregation between axis and graph area. Similar to the previous point, the segregation between the axis and the graph area is not clear. recommended to give the axis another colour."

The ggplot object consists of a few layers, ‘Data’, ‘Aesthetics’, ‘Geometrics’, ‘Facets’, ‘Statistics’ ‘Coordinate Systems’ and ‘Themes’. The first 3 layers are the most important.\nIn the code hunk below, we set the ‘data’ to sgsubsettop9 and specify which columns to use, then specify what ‘geometrics’ to use, before usiing coord flip to turn the bar horizonal() and facet_warp() to show the 9 planning areas in a trellis display.\n\nDefining ggplot object\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nFor an Age-Sex pyramid, it is important to flip one of the gender to the left side of 0 by making the values negative.\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nagesexP <- ggplot(sgsubsettop9,aes(x = `Age_group`, y = Population,fill = Gender)) + \n  geom_bar(data = subset(sgsubsettop9,Gender == 'Females'), stat = 'identity') + \n  geom_bar(data = subset(sgsubsettop9,Gender == 'Males'), stat = 'identity', mapping = aes(y = -(Population))) + \n  coord_flip() + \n  facet_wrap(~`Planning_Area`,ncol = 3)\n\n#i can't get the custom y scales to work with facet_warp, preserving the code here in case i learn the fix to this. this was originally intended to minimise the zeros, making it easier to read in intervals of '50 thousands'\n#   scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-150000, 150000, 50000),\n#                      labels = paste0(as.character(c(seq(150, 0, -50), seq(50, 150, 50)))))\n\n\nAfter the ggplot object has been created, we now try to beautify the plot by adding themes via ggthemes as well as giving it proper titles and labels\n\n\nBeautifying and drawing the visualisation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe default quarto figure size for code output is too small, we will use the RMarkdown commands, fig-height and fig-width to adjust the figure size\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nagesexP +\n  ggtitle(\"Singapore Age-Sex Pyramid (top 9 populous Planning Area) - June 2022\") + \n  theme_economist() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, vjust = 3)) + \n  xlab(\"Age Group\") + \n  ylab(\"Population\")+\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c('lightpink2','steelblue3'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI experimented with ggplotly and ggiraph but can’t get the interactive elements and scales to show up correctly together with the other facets and themes.\n\n\n\n\n\nComparisons between using Tableau and ‘R’\nTableau provides a visual and convenient way to create presentation ready visualisations without any coding knowledge. This makes tableau much more accessible to the general public and comapnies.\nOn the other hand, visualisations in ‘R’ can achieve the same if not better visualisation that Tableau with much more granular control over the various attributes and objects shown. However the caveat is that coding knowledge is required and some of the packages may not always work well with each other without more extensive research. for example, i was unable to get the ggthemes package to work with ggiraph and plotly. i also faced problems in getting scale_y_continuous() to work with facet_wrap().\nIn the end, which tool to use will probably end up being determined by an individual’s proficiency with either tools."
